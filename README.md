current binds: standard wasd movement e: dash freezes y velocity for a short time and increases forward velocity cooldown is like a second for now `: clipping mode probably doesn't work right now, will update when actually needed r: reset player to 0, 0, 0

gameplay information:

you can climb walls by looking at them right in front
wallrunning is a little wonky right now, better system for detecting will be implemented soon
vertical velocity is super important for wallrunning
general information:

need to alt+f4 to close window (i'm too lazy to change that right now)
weird mesh in the middle of the test area is a procedural cloud test
currently no way to actually lose or reset
